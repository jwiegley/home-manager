== Release 23.11

This is the current unstable branch and the information in this section is therefore not final.

[[sec-release-23.11-highlights]]
=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* When using <<opt-programs.fish.enable>>, the setup code
for <<opt-home.sessionVariables>> is now translated
with https://github.com/bouk/babelfish[babelfish].
This should result in significantly faster shell startup times
but could theoretically break
if you have very complex bash expressions in a session variable.
Please report any issues you experience.
