# Release 24.05 {#sec-release-24.05}

This is the current unstable branch and the information in this section
is therefore not final.

## Highlights {#sec-release-24.05-highlights}

This release has the following notable changes:

-   The `.release` file in the Home Manager project root has been
    removed. Please use the `release.json` file instead.

- The {command}`home-manager uninstall` command has been reworked to,
  hopefully, be more robust. The new implementation makes use of a new
  Boolean configuration option [uninstall](#opt-uninstall) that can
  also be used in a pure Nix Flake setup.

  Specifically, if you are using a Flake only installation, then you
  can clean up a Home Manager installation by adding

  ``` nix
  uninstall = true;
  ```

  to your existing configuration and then build and activate. This
  will override any other configuration and cause, for example, the
  removal of all managed files.

  Please be very careful when enabling this option since activating
  the built configuration will not only remove the managed files but
  _all_ Home Manager state from your user environment. This includes
  removing all your historic Home Manager generations!

The state version in this release includes the changes below. These
changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to
