=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* The <<opt-home.stateVersion>> option no longer has a default value.
It used to default to ``18.09'', which was the Home Manager version
that introduced the option. If your configuration does not explicitly
set this option then you need to add
+
[source,nix]
home.stateVersion = "18.09";
+
to your configuration.
